Alice: Hi Bob, have you heard about the new AI tools from Google?
Bob: Yes, the Gemini models are quite impressive! Have you tried them?
Alice: I'm using one right now to generate this conversation.
Bob: That's amazing! The voices sound so natural.
Alice: I know! You can even assign different voices to different speakers.
Bob: That's perfect for creating educational content or audio stories.
Alice: Exactly. And it detects the speakers automatically from the script format.
Bob: This is going to make creating dialogue-based content so much easier!
